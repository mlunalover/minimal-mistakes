I am excited by the new Atlanta that is emerging every day. Whether it’s the revitalization happening at Ponce City Market or what’s about to happen on Memorial Drive, Atlanta is an exciting place to be right now. I enjoy everything this city has to offer including random street art and murals, amazing restaurants, craft breweries, BeltLine events and neighborhood festivals.

I am lucky enough to call the historic Grant Park neighborhood home, where I live with my wife and our three cats and one dog. Our 100 year old home has taught me new skills so now that in addition to being a front end web developer I might also qualify as a carpenter, plumber and painter.

My wife and I founded a raw pet food company, Rebel Raw, where we run all aspects of the business- website, production, packaging, marketing and retailing. With all those animals we kind of had to.
