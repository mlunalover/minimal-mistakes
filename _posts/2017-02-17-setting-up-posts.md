I got tired of paying to host my site so I started using Github pages for this site. It works nicely using [Jekll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for maintaining my blog. Using Michael Rose's great [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/) theme. Since it takes advantage of YAML front matter blocks so it was very easy to fill the in variables I need and start posting.
